    <h2>Every Device is a Field Unit</h2>

    <p>
        Each device running Paranormal Pro functions as a fully
        independent logging and investigation center.
    </p>

    <p>
        Every investigator captures EMF readings, motion events,
        audio sessions, photographs, and video recordings directly
        on their own device — fully timestamped and documented.
    </p>

    <div class="highlight">
        Distributed field logging.
        Centralized command control.

<section>
    <h2>Designated Master Command Center</h2>

    <p>
        One device may be designated as the Master Command Center.
        Team devices connect via secure Bluetooth synchronization.
    </p>

    <p>
        When investigation mode is activated, all connected devices
        begin logging simultaneously.
    </p>

    <p>
        When the investigation ends, all logging concludes together —
        creating a synchronized investigative record.
    </p>
</section>

<section>
    <h2>Case Capsule Upload</h2>

    <p>
        After the session, each investigator uploads their
        encrypted Case Capsule to the Master Command Center.
    </p>

    <p>
        All data is merged into a unified master evidence timeline,
        clearly labeled by:
    </p>

    <ul>
        <li>Investigator name</li>
        <li>Device origin</li>
        <li>Room or location investigated</li>
        <li>Exact timestamp of capture</li>
    </ul>

    <div class="highlight">
        Multi-device investigations become one structured,
        defensible case record.
    </div>
</section>

<section>
    <h2>Why It Matters</h2>

    <p>
        Traditional investigations rely on disconnected equipment
        and manually synchronized notes.
    </p>

    <p>
        Paranormal Pro transforms your team into a coordinated
        investigative network — operating with precision,
        synchronization, and credibility.
